<h1>Proposed design for offloading model<a class="headerlink" href="#proposed-design-for-offloading-model" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<section id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This document covers the proposed design for using the new offloading model for
the DPC++ Compiler.  This leverages the existing community Offloading
design <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/intel/llvm/blob/clang/docs/OffloadingDesign.rst">OffloadingDesign</a> which covers the Clang driver and code generation
steps for creating offloading applications.</p>
<p>The current offloading model is completely encapsulated within the Clang
Compiler Driver requiring the driver to perform all of the additional steps
for generating the host and device compilation passes.  The Driver is also
responsible for initiating any of the link-time processing that occurs for
each device target.</p>
<p>The updated offloading model removes much of the functionality that is
performed during the link phase of the offloading compilation from the driver
and moves it to a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clang-linker-wrapper</span></code> tool.</p>
<p>Below is a general representation of the overall offloading flow that is
performed during a full compilation from source to final executable.  The
compiler driver is responsible for creating the fat object and the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clang-linker-wrapper</span></code> tool is responsible for the general functionality that is
performed during the link.</p>

<section id="fat-binary-generation">
<h2>Fat Binary Generation<a class="headerlink" href="#fat-binary-generation" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The generation of the fat binary will be controlled by the driver.  The model
from the community is generating the fat binary as a secondary process when
creating the host object.  Generation will be separated from the host
compilation step.  This is being done to enable proper support for using an
external host compiler as well as taking advantage of potential parallelism
during compilation of both the host and target device binaries.</p>
<p>The fat object in the new model is generated during the host compilation.
The host compilation takes an additional argument which points to the device
binary which will be embedded in the final object.  Generation will be
separated out to allow for potential parallelism during compilation of both the
host and target device binaries.</p>

<section id="packager">
<h3>Packager<a class="headerlink" href="#packager" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>When dealing with multiple device binaries, an additional step is performed to
package the multiple device binaries before being added to the host object.
This additional step is performed with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clang-offload-packager</span></code> taking
image inputs containing information relating to the target triple,
architecture setting and offloading kind.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clang-offload-packager</span></code> is run during ‘fat object’ generation regardless
of the number of device binaries being added to the conglomerate fat object.
The device binaries are contained in what is designated as an ‘Offload Binary’.
These binaries can reside in a variety of binary formats including Bitcode
files, ELF objects, executables and shared objects, COFF objects, archives or
simply stored as an offload binary.</p>
<p>We should have the ability to package SPIR-V based device binaries in the
offload section of any given binary.  These device binaries will be packaged
as normal with the packager and placed within the given section.</p>
<p>Example usage of the external <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clang-offload-packager</span></code> call:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clang-offload-packager</span> <span class="pre">--image=file=&lt;name&gt;,triple=&lt;triple&gt;,kind=&lt;kind&gt;</span></code></p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="clang-linker-wrapper">
<h2>Clang Linker Wrapper<a class="headerlink" href="#clang-linker-wrapper" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clang-linker-wrapper</span></code> provides the interface to perform the needed link
steps when consuming fat binaries.  The linker wrapper performs a majority of
the work involved during the link step during an offload compilation,
significantly reducing the amount of work that is occuring in the compiler
driver.  From the compilation perspective, the linker wrapper replaces the
typical call to the host link.  This allows for the responsibility of the
compiler driver to be nearly identical when performing a regular compilation
vs an offloading compilation.</p>
<p>From a high level, using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clang-linker-wrapper</span></code> provides a few benefits:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Moves all of the device linking responsibility out of the compiler driver.</p></li>
<li><p>Allows for a more direct ability to perform linking for offloading without
requiring the use of the driver, using more linker like calls.</p></li>
<li><p>Provides additional flexibility with the ability to dynamically modify
the toolchain execution.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Example usage of the external <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clang-linker-wrapper</span></code> call:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clang-linker-wrapper</span> <span class="pre">&lt;wrapper</span> <span class="pre">opts&gt;</span> <span class="pre">--</span> <span class="pre">&lt;linker</span> <span class="pre">opts&gt;</span></code></p>
<section id="device-extraction">
<h3>Device Extraction<a class="headerlink" href="#device-extraction" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>During the compilation step, the device binaries are embedded in a section of
the host binary. When performing the link, this section is extracted from the
object and mapped according to the device kind.  The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clang-linker-wrapper</span></code>
is responsible for examining all of the input binaries, grabbing the embedded
device binaries and determining any additional device linking paths that need
to be taken.</p>
<p>For example, when an embedded device binary is of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">OFK_SYCL</span></code> kind and of
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">spir64_gen</span></code> architecture triple, the resulting extracted binary is linked,
post-link processed and converted to SPIR-V before being passed to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ocloc</span></code> to
generate the final device binary.  Options passed via <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--gen-tool-arg=</span></code> will
be applied to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ocloc</span></code> step as well.</p>
<p>Binaries generated during the offload compilation will be ‘bundled’ together
to create a conglomerate fat binary.  Depending on the type of binary, the
device is embedded as follows:</p>
<section id="objects">
<h4>Objects<a class="headerlink" href="#objects" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Object types considered are COFF objects, ELF executables, ELF relocatable
objects and ELF shared objects.  The device section of the object is in a
section marked by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.llvm.offloading</span></code> for COFF objects.  For ELF files, there is
a section marked with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LLVM_OFFLOADING</span></code> type.</p>
</section>
<section id="bitcode">
<h4>Bitcode<a class="headerlink" href="#bitcode" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>The section which contains the offloading data is from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.llvm.offloading</span></code>
section within the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">llvm.embedded.object</span></code> metadata.</p>
</section>
<section id="offload-binary">
<h4>Offload Binary<a class="headerlink" href="#offload-binary" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>The binary itself can be represented by just an offload binary, not requiring
to be in a section of another binary.  This representation is used for any
kind of device only binary that is created.  The device only binaries are
represented by the file generated from the <a class="reference internal" href="#packager">Packager</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="archives">
<h4>Archives<a class="headerlink" href="#archives" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Each item in the archive will be extracted and will be individually checked for
the file type, properly performing extraction based on the file types already
listed above.</p>
</section>
<section id="support-of-existing-fat-object-format">
<h4>Support of existing fat object format<a class="headerlink" href="#support-of-existing-fat-object-format" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>The current model generates fat objects using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clang-offload-bundler</span></code>
tool.  This tool creates a binary that contains individual sections that are
labeled with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__CLANG_OFFLOAD_BUNDLE__kind-triple</span></code>.  This format does not
match the new format as described above.  To enable an ease of transition
from the old model to the new model, support will be added that allows for
support of identifying and extracting device binaries that are using the old
model.</p>
<p>It is expected that all new binaries generated with the updated offloading
model will represent the embedded fat object format, moving away from the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clang-offload-bundler</span></code> usage.  We will not support a mixing of fat object
formats such as objects created with the bundler combined with embedded objects
in a single archive or objects created with an embedded offload section and
additional sections generated with the bundler.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="device-linking">
<h3>Device Linking<a class="headerlink" href="#device-linking" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>During this phase, all of the individual device binaries that are extracted and
are associated with a given target are worked on given the type of binary we
are working with.  The default device code is typically represented in LLVM-IR
which requires an additional link step of the device code before being
wrapped and integrated into the final executable.  As mentioned in
<a class="reference internal" href="#packager">Packager</a> device representation in SPIR-V should be considered
with the ability to link native SPIR-V modules.  Performing the device link
against LLVM-IR is performed by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">llvm-link</span></code>.</p>
<p>To reduce the potential size of the linked device binary, an additional host
link step is performed to gather dependency information when static device
libraries are being compiled.  This information is sent through the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clang-offload-deps</span></code> tool to generate a dependency IR file which is used
during the device link step.</p>
<p>The use of the clang-linker-wrapper introduces the support of LTO for
device code.  We can leverage this and move away from the dependency gathering
information step with ‘clang-offload-deps’ and use thinLTO for device code.</p>
<p>There are multiple device linking steps that also occur.  The first step links
together all of the objects and the required device libraries.  The second is
performed including all of optional device libraries, the static device
libraries and the dependency information that was gathered above.  This link
step is performed with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--only-needed</span></code> to streamline the final device binary.</p>
<p>A list of device libraries that need to linked in with user code is provided by
the driver.  The driver is also responsible for letting the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clang-linker-wrapper</span></code> know the location of the device libraries.</p>

<h3>Ahead Of Time Compilation<a class="headerlink" href="#ahead-of-time-compilation" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The updated offloading model will integrate the Ahead of Time (AOT) compilation
behaviors into the clang-linker-wrapper.  The actions will typically take place
after the device link, post link, and LLVM-IR to SPIR-V translation steps.</p>
<p>Regardless of the AOT target, the flow is similar, only modifying the offline

<section id="spir64-gen-support">
<h4>spir64_gen support<a class="headerlink" href="#spir64-gen-support" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Compilation behaviors involving AOT for GPU involve an additional call to
the OpenCL Offline compiler (OCLOC).  This call occurs after the post-link
step performed by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sycl-post-link</span></code> and the SPIR-V translation step which is done
by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">llvm-spirv</span></code>.  Additional options passed by the user via the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-Xsycl-target-backend=spir64_gen</span> <span class="pre">&lt;opts&gt;</span></code> command as well as the implied
options set via target options such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-fsycl-targets=intel_gpu_skl</span></code>
will be processed by a new options to the wrapper, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--gen-tool-arg=&lt;arg&gt;</span></code></p>
<p>To support multiple target specifications, for instance:
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-fsycl-targets=intel_gpu_skl,intel_gpu_pvc</span></code>, multiple <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--gen-tool-arg</span></code>
options can be passed on the command line.  Each instance will be considered
a separate OCLOC call passing along the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;args&gt;</span></code> as options to the OCLOC call.
The compiler driver will be responsible for putting together the full option
list to be passed along.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>-fsycl -fsycl-targets=spir64_gen,intel_gpu_skl
-Xsycl-target-backend=spir64_gen “-device pvc -options -extraopt_pvc”

<p><em>Example: spir64_gen enabling options</em></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>–gen-tool-arg=”-device pvc -options extraopt_pvc”
–gen-tool-arg=”-device skl -options -extraopt_skl”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><em>Example: clang-linker-wrapper options</em></p>
<p>Each OCLOC call will be represented as a separate device binary that is
individually wrapped and linked into the final executable.</p>
<p>Additionally, the syntax can be expanded to enable the ability to pass specific
options to a specific device GPU target for spir64_gen.  The syntax will
resemble <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--gen-tool-arg=&lt;arch&gt;</span> <span class="pre">&lt;arg&gt;</span></code>.  This corresponds to the existing
option syntax of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-fsycl-targets=intel_gpu_arch</span></code> where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">arch</span></code> can be a fixed

<h4>spir64_fpga support<a class="headerlink" href="#spir64-fpga-support" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Compilation behaviors involving AOT for FPGA involve an additional call to
either <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">aoc</span></code> (for Hardware/Simulation) or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">opencl-aot</span></code> (for Emulation).  This
call occurs after the post-link step performed by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sycl-post-link</span></code> and the
SPIR-V translation step performed by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">llvm-spirv</span></code>.  Additional options passed
by the user via the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-Xsycl-target-backend=spir64_fpga</span> <span class="pre">&lt;opts&gt;</span></code> command will be
processed by a new options to the wrapper,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--fpga-tool-arg=&lt;arg&gt;</span></code></p>
<p>The FPGA target also has support for additional generated binaries that
contain intermediate files specific for FPGA.  These binaries (aoco, aocr and
aocx) can reside in archives and are treated differently than traditional
device binaries.</p>
<p>Generation of the AOCR and AOCX type binary is triggered by the command line
option <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-fsycl-link</span></code>, where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-fsycl-link=image</span></code> creates AOCX archives and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-fsycl-link=early</span></code> generates AOCR archives.  The files generated by these
options are handled in a specific manner when encountered.</p>
<p>Any archive with an AOCR type device binary will have the AOCR binary
extracted and passed to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">aoc</span></code> to produce an AOCX final image.  This final
image is wrapped and added to the final binary during the host link.  The use
of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-fsycl-link=image</span></code> with an AOCR binary will create an AOCX based archive
instead of completing the host link.  Any archive with an AOCX type device
binary skips the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">aoc</span></code> step and is wrapped and added to the final binary during
the host link.  Archives with any AOCO device binaries are extracted and passed
through to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">aoc</span> <span class="pre">-library-list=&lt;listfile&gt;</span></code></p>
<p>As the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clang-linker-wrapper</span></code> is responsible for understanding the archives
that are added on the command line, it will need to know when to look for
these unique device binaries based on the expected compilation targets.  The
behavior of creating the AOCX/AOCR type archive will be triggered via an
additional command line option specified by the driver when <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-fsycl-link</span></code>
options are used.  The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--fpga-link=&lt;type&gt;</span></code> option will tell the wrapper when
these handlings need to occur.</p>
<p>When using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-fintelfpga</span></code> option to enable AOT for FPGA, there are
additional expectations during the compilation.  Use of the option will enable
debug generation and also generate dependency information.  The dependency
generation should be packaged along with the device binary for use during
the link phase.  It is expected that the full fat object, containing host,
device and dependency file is generated before being passed to the link phase.
The dependency information is only used when compiling for hardware.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clang-linker-wrapper</span></code> tool will be responsible to determine which FPGA
tool is being used during the AOT device compilation phase.  The use of
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-simulation</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-hardware</span></code> as passed in by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--fpga-tool-arg</span></code> signifies
which tool is used.</p>

<h4>spir64_x86_64 support<a class="headerlink" href="#spir64-x86-64-support" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Compilation behaviors involving AOT for CPU involve an additional call to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">opencl-aot</span></code>.  This call occurs after the post-link step performed by
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sycl-post-link</span></code> and the SPIR-V translation step performed by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">llvm-spirv</span></code>.
Additional options passed by the user via the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-Xsycl-target-backend=spir64_x86_64</span> <span class="pre">&lt;opts&gt;</span></code> command will be processed by a new
option to the wrapper, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--cpu-tool-arg=&lt;arg&gt;</span></code></p>

<h3>Wrapping of device image<a class="headerlink" href="#wrapping-of-device-image" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Once the device binary is pulled out of the fat binary, the binary must be
wrapped and provided the needed entry points to be used during execution.  This
is performed during the link phase and controlled by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clang-linker-wrapper</span></code>.</p>
<p>It is expected that the wrap information that is generated to be wrapped
around the device binary will match current wrapping information that is used
for the existing offload model.  The wrapping in the old model is using the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clang-offload-wrapper</span></code> tool.</p>

<h3>Integration of llvm-foreach<a class="headerlink" href="#integration-of-llvm-foreach" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Use of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">llvm-foreach</span></code> is used frequently during the offloading process.  The
functionality was introduced due to the toolchain building limitations of the
driver and the need perform multiple compilations during a specific step of
the compilation.  For example, the support for device code splitting performed
by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sycl-post-link</span></code> tool would require consumers of the split code to work
each item individually.  The driver toolchain does not know that this split
occurs, or how many splits were performed.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">llvm-foreach</span></code> permits this
obfuscation.</p>
<p>With the new model, the compilation sequence is built dynamically within the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clang-linker-wrapper</span></code>, allowing for the use of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">llvm-foreach</span></code> to become
obsolete.  The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clang-linker-wrapper</span></code> is then responsible for performing the
needed individual calls work item which can be done using parallel for.</p>

<h4>Beyond llvm-foreach and similar job hiding tools<a class="headerlink" href="#beyond-llvm-foreach-and-similar-job-hiding-tools" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Tools like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">llvm-foreach</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">file-table-tform</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">spirv-to-ir-wrapper</span></code> were all
introduced to provide a way to manipulate behaviors that could only be
determined at runtime of the compiler toolchain.  These were needed to work
around the fact that the toolchain commands constructed by the driver is a fixed
state of commands.</p>
<p>Moving the functionality into <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clang-linker-wrapper</span></code> presents the opportunity
step away from the static command construction and create the call chain on
the fly based on real time output from corresponding tools being called.</p>

<section id="host-link">
<h3>Host Link<a class="headerlink" href="#host-link" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The final host link is also performed by the linker wrapper.  This link is
built upon the full link command line as constructed by the compiler driver,
including all libraries and the linked/wrapped device binaries to complete the
compilation process.</p>
<p>The provided command line for the final host link step contains the full list
of libraries and objects to be linked against.  The expectation is for this
list to be complete.  With the old model, the host objects are directly passed
to the host link step.  The device objects are processed separately.  As we are
passing the full command line to the link step, the objects provided will need
to be full fat objects.  This is different from the old model which will
require for an additional step before the link to create the full fat object
that is properly represented on the host link command line.  This additional
step is necessary due to the fact that we are creating the fat objects during
a separate step as opposed to integrating the offload binaries during the
host object generation.  See <a class="reference internal" href="#fat-binary-generation">Fat Binary Generation</a>.</p>

<h2>Transitioning from old model to new model<a class="headerlink" href="#transitioning-from-old-model-to-new-model" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The binary representation of the fat objects is not equivalent when dealing
with differences between the old and the new model.  Behavior of the new
model will be guarded by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--offload-new-driver</span></code> compiler switch.  This will
allow for implementation of the model without disturbing the existing behavior.
When we are ready to make the switch over, it is a matter of making the
switch the default mode.</p>
<p>Initial representation of the fat objects will be represented by the existing
format created by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clang-offload-bundler</span></code>.  This will allow for older
binaries to continue to be consumed with the updated offloading model.  We will
transition to the packager representation at a future date.</p>
